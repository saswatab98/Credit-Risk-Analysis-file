# Loan Default Credit Risk Analytics with EDA  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
This project focuses on using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to minimize financial risks in the banking and financial services sector. By analyzing loan application data, we aim to help loan-providing companies make better decisions regarding loan approvals, ensuring creditworthy applicants are not rejected while minimizing the risk of defaults.

## 🔍 Business Understanding  

Lending companies face two key risks:  
1. **Rejecting applicants who can repay loans**, leading to a loss of business.  
2. **Approving loans for likely defaulters**, causing financial losses.  

The goal is to identify patterns in consumer and loan attributes that indicate payment difficulties and to develop insights to improve decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Objectives  
- Identify strong indicators of loan default using EDA.  
- Suggest actions like loan denial, amount reduction, or higher interest rates for risky applicants.  
- Enhance portfolio and risk assessment strategies.

## 📂 Dataset  

This project uses three datasets:  

1. **`application_data.csv`**: Contains client information at the time of loan application, including payment history.  
2. **`previous_application.csv`**: Provides details of the client’s past loan applications, including outcomes like Approved, Cancelled, Refused, or Unused offers.  
3. **`columns_description.csv`**: A data dictionary explaining the meaning of variables in the datasets.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow  

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
2. **Univariate Analysis**: Understand individual variable distributions.  
3. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships between variables and their impact on default risk.  
4. **Insights & Visualization**: Identify patterns and visualize trends.

## 🚀 Key Insights  

- **Payment Difficulties**: Patterns in consumer profiles linked to delayed payments.  
- **Previous Applications**: Insights into how past loan outcomes affect current applications.  
- **Driving Factors**: Strong indicators like income levels, loan amount, and repayment history were uncovered.
